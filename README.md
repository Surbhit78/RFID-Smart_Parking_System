# RFID-Smart_Parking_System
This repository contains the code to my project entitled "RFID Based Smart Parking Management System".

In this paper, the adoption of passive RF identification (RFID) tag-to-tag communication paradigm within the context of a smart parking system is evangelized, in terms of achieving improved energy-efficiency and operational effectiveness. To demonstrate that the joint routing and RFID readers’ transmission power minimization problem is studied, considering tag-to-tag communication. The superiority of the proposed framework against conventional direct RFID reader-tag communication is demonstrated in terms of: 





(i) reduction of RFID readers’ transmission power to the minimum required to guarantee connectivity, and 




(ii) expansion of RFID reader’s coverage area towards communicating with more distant tags, otherwise unreachable through direct communication.
